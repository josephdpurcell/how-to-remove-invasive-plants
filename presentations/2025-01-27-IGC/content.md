## Disclaimer <!-- omit in toc -->

I am not an expert, this is simply my perspective.

## Assumptions <!-- omit in toc -->

- You are wanting to develop skills for removing invasive plants and are a beginner
- You know the importance of getting rid of invasive plants (impact on state parks and local ecology)
- You take ownership over your space(s) and want to do better

<!-- TODO: move this to the end as closing thoughts -->

## Not Included <!-- omit in toc -->

- How is the native ecosystem adapting to non-native invasive species?
- Why do non-native species tend to be invasive?
- Why are invasive plants still being sold? (eg. Dammann's)
- Why do people buy and cultivate invasive plants?

## Terminology

### Native vs Non-Native

Native species are indigenous to the ecosystem.

(eg. Trumpet Vine, Poison Ivy)

Non-native species are not indigenous.

(eg. Amur Honeysuckle, Dandelion)

Resources: [BONAP](http://www.bonap.org/), [USDA](https://plants.usda.gov/), [ITIS](https://www.itis.gov/)

<div class="fragment">

> Native status is difficult to define and is somewhat arbitrary (USDA)

</div>

### Net-negative Benefit

- Offers less or no food supply (for native life)
- Crowds out native plants (which do offer food)
- Changes structure and content of soil (causes erosion, suppression of native growth)

<p class="fragment">
Example: my childhood forrest is now Vinca. Its beauty doesn't outweigh the cost of having no more berries or mushrooms.
</p>

### Managed vs Unmanaged

A managed planting area has humans shaping the ecosystem.

An unmanaged planting area is wild; it does not have humans shaping the ecosystem.

<p class="fragment">
Example: that forrest is unmanaged, but the home and farm nearby where the Vinca came from is managed.
</p>

### Invasive vs Non-Invasive

Invasive species result in net-negative benefit for an ecosystem. (eg. Wintercreeper)

Non-invasive species are neutral or positive. (eg. Tomatoes)

Resources: [GISD](https://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/), [NISIC](https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/terrestrial/plants), [NatureServe](https://explorer.natureserve.org/)

<p class="fragment">
Question: Trumpet Vine is a native, but is considered invasive in managed areas and non-invasive in unmanaged areas?
</p>

<!--
Uncertainty... !-- omit in toc --

- What about native Trumpet Vine and Goldenrod or non-native Dandylion and White Clover?
- How bad does it have to be to be invasive?
- Is a grass yard with 20% natives worse than a native yard but 20% invasives?
- How much of the USDA and IISC invasive lists are driven by economics versus ecology?

<span class="fragment">
Ultimately, you decide the future of the species.

60% of land is private so despite what any USDA or IISC list says is invasive they won't do anything about plants in your yard.
</span> -->

<!-- ### Singular Focus !-- omit in toc --

Our singular focus is non-native invasive plants that are unquestionably harmful to the native ecosystem. -->

## Skills

Skills are how you get rid of invasive plants.

- What is it
- When to use it
- How to apply it

### Bio Material Handling

Handle bio material safely and with control.

When: always, nature is powerful

#### Protective Clothing

You will encounter toxins, thorns, and burrs.

(eg. myocarditis from Tree of Heaven sap)

<p style="text-align:left">Clothing to consider:</p>

- Thick leather gloves (single most important!)
- Long sleeves and long pants with very tight weave (eg polyester running clothes)
- Hat
- Sturdy shoes (eg. leather boots)

#### Biochar

You cannot leave plants to decompose without propagation risk.

Burning them into biochar terminates them, is carbon neutral ([link](https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/questions/7009/is-burning-wood-the-same-as-letting-it-biodegrade-from-a-co2-emissions-perspecti)), and is a soil encrichment ([link](https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/biochar)).

- Option 1: Burn barrel with dolly so you can burn on site. See online videos for strategy and safety considerations.
- Option 2: Trench burn is good at handling large quantities. Requires higher degree of safety working with fire.

#### Bagging

If the plant has gone to seed/fruit make sure you bag it immediately on site.

Treat it as a hazardous material.

Don't leave it in the bag to mold.

### Displacement

Force invasive plants out of their occupied space by promoting native plants.

When: pair with removal or smothering

#### Promote Strong Natives

- American Black Raspberry > Wintercreeper, Sweet Autumn Clematis
- Riverbank Grapevine > Wintercreeper
- Goldenrod > Wintercreeper

#### Keep Adding Natives

It's a numbers game.

Good luck finding natives for sale! Once or twice a year there's a sale, see INSP and Indy Parks Alliance.

Grow from seed.

And, don't trust the label. I bought Red Mulberry that PPDL diagnosed as White Mulberry, and WDNR issued stop order for nursery.

### Exhaustion

Reduce a plant's energy stores, reproductive means, access to food, or energy production through mechanical means.

When: removal isn't viable, you don't want to poison, or an area is saturated with invasives

#### Removal of Sources

Plants don't respect fences. Invasive plants are great at propagating from elsewhere.

Talk to your neighbors.

[Irvington Burn Fest](https://www.irvburnfest.com/) on October 5, 2025.

#### Smother

Excellent option for large areas.

Cut off energy production (photosynthesis) by covering.

First, mow it to the bare ground. Then, add a covering:

- Plastic: UV stabilized plastic, 1000 gauge or 6 mil (~0.15-0.25 mm), remove after a year
- Cardboard: avoid toxic ink and remove tape, secure to ground
- Mulch: 2-4" thick

Note: dirt, solarization (clear plastic to heat), propoane torch

#### Annual Cutting

Excellent option for precision.

Once after spring growth and again in fall before winter.

Use loppers, clippers, snips, or weed eater.

I do this with White Mulberry, Japanese Knotweed, vines (English Ivy, Wintercreeper) that climb, Creeping Thistle.

### Identification

Sufficiently determine a plant is invasive.

When: always; never remove a plant unless you know what it is and 1 reason itâ€™s beneficial

Note: Only need to sufficiently identify, doesn't have to be species.

#### Seek

Open the app and point.

Indicates if native or endangered and gives photos to compare.

Limitations! Some species it doesn't get and sometimes it gets a bad photo.

#### iNaturalist

Online forum where experts will help classify your plants.

Requires higher level of skill and more datapoints.

Contributes to research!

#### Observe

Look around. Invasive plants are obvious.

- Does it turn green before anything else and stay green longer?
- Do birds know how to nest in it or eat its fruit/seed? (Question of nutritional content)
- How many bugs are there on it versus native plants?
- How quickly does it grow?

Note: See how invasives productivity compares to the best, goldenrod, aster, black raspberry, pokeberry

### Perseverance

Continue removal efforts despite adversity or inability to envision success.

When: always

#### Tips on Persevering

- Think in geological time. You may not see results in your lifetime.
- Remember first principles: do it because it's right, not because it's easy or for results
- Community support: you aren't alone in the struggle
- Don't do it alone: invasive removal is a communal effort

Note: someone named Liz overheard me and went on a rant about how hard it is to promote native plants

### Planning

Optimize effort to maximize ecological benefit.

When: always

#### Divide and Conquer

<p style="text-align:left">Don't require focus:</p>

- Unmanaged barren areas that don't require maintenance (eg. driveway, house, garage).
- Unmanaged native areas that are wild. Check annually before invasives seed/flower.
- Unmanaged invasive areas that are contained. Check annually they are contained (no seeds/flowers).

Note: example of unmanaged invasive is wintercreeper with no trees, or a smothered area.

#### Divide and Conquer

<p style="text-align:left">Require focus:</p>

- Managed native areas that are progressing into wild but still require weeding and invasive removal.
- Managed invasive areas should immediately be converted into managed native or unmanaged invasive by containment.

### Poison

Reduce a plant's energy stores, reproductive means, access to food, or energy production through chemical means.

When: cancer analogy, destructive means for greater good

#### Triclopr

CAUTION! Poison is poison, handle accordingly!

- Put on plastic gloves
- Fill dauber bottle
- Cut plant or bend to expose stem
- Daub a few times until stem cut is saturated
- Do NOT touch your skin!
- Apply when it is not going to rain for 24 hrs

Note: Used by Dept. of Land Stewardship. Alt method is squirt bottle.

#### White Vinegar and Salt

I've experimented with 50% White Vinegar (the regular 3% stuff) and 50% rock salt. Seems to kill growth of that stem.

### Removal

Remove a plant from an area through mechanical means.

When: always when you have the strength

Note: don't hurt yourself!

#### Plants <2'

<p style="text-align:left">Tend to do fine pulling by hand:</p>

- Key is to get all of the root!
- Delicate plants like Creeping Thistle and Japanese Knotweed can sometimes be pulled by hand when the soil is very wet without much fuss.
- Sometimes I first loosen with a quick trowel jab.
- For strong roots like Amur Honeysuckle saplings you can yank away.

#### Plants >2'

<p style="text-align:left">Requires strategy:</p>

- First, cut the canopy down to the ground. Loppers are preferred tool.
- Dig surrounding the stump about 1' away from center. If shovel can't cut the root dig until roots are exposed and use loppers.
- Pry up with bar.
- Easier when soil is wet.
- Be careful! Know when its too big.
- Regular stretching and exercise can boost your skill.

### Legal Understanding

Understand the legal constraints of invasive plant removal.

When: always know the basics

#### TODO

How:

- city ordinance
- sale of invasives
- what other retaliation against invasive?

### Wilding

Dedicate an area to become an unmanaged native area.

When: you want less effort or want to maximize benefit to native ecosystem

#### TODO

- Key is to make a space where invasives can't get a foothold
- Remove anything that prevents native growth (eg invasive plants, trash)
- Zero human disturbance
