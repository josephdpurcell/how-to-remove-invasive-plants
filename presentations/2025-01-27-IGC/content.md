## Not Included <!-- omit in toc -->

- How is the native ecosystem adapting to non-native invasive species?

## Terminology

### Native vs Non-Native

Native species are indigenous to the ecosystem. (eg. Trumpet Vine)

Non-native species are not indigenous. (eg. Amur Honeysuckle)

### Net-negative Benefit

A plant has net-negative benefit:

- Offers less or no food supply (for native life)
- Crowds out native plants (which do offer food)
- Changes structure and content of soil (causes erosion, supression of native growth)

<p class="fragment">
Example: my childhood forrest is now Vinca. Its beautiy doesn't outweigh the cost of having no more berries or mushrooms.
</p>

### Managed vs Unmanaged

A managed planting area has humans shaping the ecosystem.

An unmanaged planting area is wild; it does not have humans shaping the ecosystem.

<p class="fragment">
Example: that forrest is unmanaged, but the home and farm nearby where the Vinca came from is managed.
</p>

### Invasive vs Non-Invasive

Invasive species result in net-negative outcomes for an ecosystem. (eg. Wintercreeper)

Non-invasive species are neutral or positive. (eg. Tomatoes)

<p class="fragment">
Example: Trumpet Vine can be a native invasive in managed areas, but would be non-invasive in unmanaged areas.
</p>

<!--
Uncertainty... !-- omit in toc --

- What about native Trumpet Vine and Goldenrod or non-native Dandylion and White Clover?
- How bad does it have to be to be invasive?
- Is a grass yard with 20% natives worse than a native yard but 20% invasives?
- How much of the USDA and IISC invasive lists are driven by economics versus ecology?

<span class="fragment">
Ultimately, you decide the future of the species.

60% of land is private so despite what any USDA or IISC list says is invasive they won't do anything about plants in your yard.

<!-- ### Singular Focus !-- omit in toc --

Our singular focus is non-native invasive plants that are unquestionably harmful to the native ecosystem. -->

## Skills

Skills are how you get rid of invasive plants.

- What is it
- Why it helps
- When to use it
- How to apply it

### Bio Material Handling

Handle bio material safely and with control.

When to use: always, nature is powerful

How:

- Treat the entire plant like a hazardous substance
- Tree of heaven causes heart arythmia
- Know when the plant has gone to seed/fruit, because at that point you need to bag it at the site of removal
- Also bag anything that can regrow like vine clippings or knotweed tubers
- Sometimes you can compose: I have a single spot where I heap leafy invasives that won’t burn well (knotweed, clematis)
- Sometimes you can burn
  - Burn barrel $20 is so versatile; there’s an art to burning, need to be mindful of how wet the environment is, how wet the material is
  - Trench burn is cool but not practical
  - Biochar

### Displacement

Force invasive plants out of their occupied space by promoting native plants.

When to use: pair with removal or smothering

How:

- Know strong plants: these can propagate and grow in the middle of Ivy
  - Am black raspberry
  - Riverbank grape vine
  - Goldenrod
- Buy or grow natives; good luck! INPS sales and conference, Indy parks alliance. Not sure when they will be announced
- Get as many native plants in your yard; in part it’s a numbers game in our neighborhood.

### Exhaustion

Reduce a plant's energy stores, reproductive means, access to food, or energy production through mechanical means.

When to use: removal isn't viable, you don't want to poison, or an area is saturated with invasives

How:

- Smother: prevent access to sunlight by covering with:
  - Plastic
  - Dirt
  - Cardboard: pain because you need to acquire the boxes, make sure they don’t have toxic ink, remove tape, arrange, secure to ground
  - Mulch: has to be a thick layer
  - Ideally some kind of dirt with native seeds
  - Keep it covered? Decorative rocks
- Keys are to prevent photosynthesis and propagation
- Do it at least once but probably twice: once after spring growth and again in Sep before winter
- Cut every year (white mulberry, knotweed, vines, creeping thistle)
  - Loppers
  - Clippers
  - Weed eater
- Get rid of source
  - Make sure any mature plants nearby are removed (see also burn fest)
  - Carry seeds in bags and burn
- Mow/weed down to dirt (optional in some cases, eg thick plastic)

### Indentification

Sufficiently determine a plant is invasive.

When to use: always; never remove a plant unless you know what it is and 1 reason it’s beneficial.

How to:

- Seek, iNaturalist

* Tech: iNaturalist, Seek
* Compare: growing in same spot, there’s others nearby
* Observe: is it everywhere, do you see native bugs and birds successfully interacting with it
* Listen to people complain: naughty list
  - Winter creeper: this might be impossible to beat
  - Clematis: it’s aggressive, kills all beneath
  - Amur: suppressive chemicals
  - White mulberry
  - English Ivy
  - Tree of heaven
  - Creeping thistle
  - Stickseed
  - Poison Ivy
  - Spanish needles
* Flip it: know the best: goldenrod, aster, black raspberry, pokeberry

Note: Only need to sufficiently identify, doesn't have to be species.

### Perseverance

Continue removal efforts despite adversity or inability to envision success.

When: always

How:

- Think in geological time. You may not see results in your lifetime.
- Remember first principles: do it because it's right, not because it's easy or for results
- Community support: learn about others who persevered
- Get help

### Planning

Optimize effort to maximize ecological benefit.

When: always

How:

- Divide and concquer; goal is unmanaged wild areas, but to get there you need managed wilding areas, and also establish some managed (TODO: without plants)

### Poison

Reduce a plant's energy stores, reproductive means, access to food, or energy production through chemical means.

When to use:

Poison: permanently kill by chemical means; this is the most difficult option, you must handle with care and do so knowing risks

When to use: cancer analogy, destructive means for greater good

How:

- Not covered is roundup (bc Triclopyr is what’s used) and spraying (bc it’s more aggressive and careless than what I like, which is precision)
- Substances
  - Triclopyr
  - White vinegar
  - Salt
- Application
  - Dauber
  - Squirt bottle
  - Dawn bottle
- Technique
  - Cut then apply
  - Use gloves and eye protection
  - Don’t do it when it rains, 24 hrs

### Removal

Remove a plant from an area through mechanical means.

When to use: always when you have the strength

How:

- Dig: don’t hurt yourself
- Cut roots w loppers
- Pry up with bar
- Wait till it’s wet
- Pull roots
- BURN! Many plants regrow

### Legal Understanding

Understand the legal constraints of invasive plant removal.

When: always know the basics

How:

- city ordinance
- sale of invasives
- what other retaliation against invasive?

### Wilding

Dedicate an area to become an unmanaged native area.

Why: creates a space that invasive plants cannot introduce themselves.

When: you have the resources

How:

- Remove anything that prevents native growth (eg invasive plants, trash)
- Zero human disturbance
