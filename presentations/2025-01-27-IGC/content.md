## Terminology

### Native vs Non-Native

Native species are indigenous to the ecosystem.

(eg. Trumpet Vine, Poison Ivy)

Non-native species are not indigenous.

(eg. Amur Honeysuckle, Dandelion)

Resources: [BONAP](http://www.bonap.org/), [USDA](https://plants.usda.gov/), [ITIS](https://www.itis.gov/)

<div class="fragment">

> Native status is difficult to define and is somewhat arbitrary (USDA)

</div>

### Net-negative Benefit

- Offers little or no food supply (for native life)
- Crowds out native plants (which do offer food)
- Changes structure and content of soil (causes erosion, suppression of native growth)

<p class="fragment">
Example: my childhood forrest is now Vinca. Its beauty doesn't outweigh the cost of having no more berries or mushrooms.
</p>

### Managed vs Unmanaged

A managed area requires human upkeep.

An unmanaged area requires little or no human involvement (eg. a day a year to audit).

<p class="fragment">
Example: my childhood forrest is unmanaged, but the home and farm nearby where the Vinca came from is managed.
</p>

### Invasive vs Non-Invasive

Invasive species result in net-negative benefit for an ecosystem. (eg. Wintercreeper)

Non-invasive species are neutral or positive. (eg. Tomatoes)

Resources: [IISC](https://ag.purdue.edu/department/entm/iisc/), [GISD](https://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/), [NISIC](https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/terrestrial/plants), [NatureServe](https://explorer.natureserve.org/)

### Perspective Matters <!-- omit in toc -->

Trumpet Vine is a non-invasive native in Indiana ([USDA](https://plants.usda.gov/plant-profile/CARA2), [Natureserve](https://explorer.natureserve.org/Taxon/ELEMENT_GLOBAL.2.148989/Campsis_radicans)).

In practice some call it invasive because it invades managed areas (eg. gardens).

Poison Ivy is native...

## Skills

Skills are how you get rid of invasive plants.

- What is it
- When to use it
- How to apply it

### Bio Material Handling

Handle bio material safely and with control.

Use when interacting with plants (Exhaustion, Poison, Removal)

#### Protective Clothing

You will encounter toxins, thorns, and burrs.

(eg. myocarditis from Tree of Heaven sap)

<p style="text-align:left">Clothing to consider:</p>

- Thick leather gloves (single most important!)
- Long sleeves and long pants with very tight weave (eg polyester running clothes)
- Hat
- Sturdy shoes (eg. leather boots)

#### Biochar

You cannot leave plants to decompose without propagation risk.

Burning them into biochar terminates them, is carbon neutral ([link](https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/questions/7009/is-burning-wood-the-same-as-letting-it-biodegrade-from-a-co2-emissions-perspecti)), and is a soil encrichment ([link](https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/biochar)).

- Option 1: Burn barrel with dolly so you can burn on site. See online videos for strategy and safety considerations.
- Option 2: Trench burn is good at handling large quantities. Requires higher degree of safety working with fire.

#### Bagging

If the plant has gone to seed/fruit make sure you bag it immediately on site using non-porous bag (eg. plastic).

Treat it as a hazardous material.

Don't leave it in the bag to mold.

### Displacement

Prevent invasive plants from occupying a space.

Use when there is vacant space (Exhaustion, Removal)

#### Methods

Two main methods:

1. Convert to barren areas, eg. rocks, grass, parking lots, buildings.
2. Convert to native areas, see also "Wilding".

### Exhaustion

Reduce a plant's energy stores, reproductive means, access to food, or energy production through mechanical means.

Use when Removal isn't viable

#### Removal of Sources

Plants don't respect fences. Invasive plants are great at propagating from elsewhere.

Talk to your neighbors.

[Irvington Burn Fest](https://www.irvburnfest.com/) on October 5, 2025.

#### Smothering

Cut off energy production (photosynthesis) by covering.

Excellent option for large areas.

First, mow it to the bare ground. Then, add a covering:

- Plastic: UV stabilized plastic, 1000 gauge or 6 mil (~0.15-0.25 mm), remove after a year
- Bio materials: let cover decompose; cut holes and plant plugs; materials:
  - Cardboard: avoid toxic ink and remove tape; secure to ground with sticks
  - Mulch: 2-4" thick

Note: newspaper, dirt, solarization (clear plastic to heat), propane torch

#### Cutting

Range from precision (loppers/clippers/snips) to annihilation (mowing/weed eating).

For plants that don't seed/fruit in their first year (eg White Mulberry) you can precision cut once after spring growth and again in fall before winter. Repeat annually.

Note: I do precision cutting with White Mulberry, Japanese Knotweed, vines that climb (English Ivy, Wintercreeper), Creeping Thistle.

### Identification

Sufficiently determine a plant is invasive.

Use when you interact with any plant

Note: Only need to sufficiently identify, doesn't have to be species.

#### Observe

Look around. Invasive plants are obvious. (All around Irvington Circle, Pennsy Trail, yards).

- Does it turn green before anything else and stay green longer?
- Do birds know how to nest in it or eat its fruit/seed? (Question of nutritional content)
- How many bugs are there on it versus native plants?
- How quickly does it grow?

Note: See how invasives productivity compares to the best, goldenrod, aster, black raspberry, pokeberry

#### Seek App

Open the app and point. (Apple and Android)

Indicates if native or endangered and gives photos to compare.

Limitations! Some species it doesn't get and sometimes it gets a bad photo.

#### iNaturalist

Online forum where experts will help classify your plants.

Requires higher level of skill and more datapoints.

Contributes to research!

#### PPDL

<div style="text-align:left">

The [Purdue Plant and Pest Diagnostics Lab](https://ag.purdue.edu/department/btny/ppdl/) can identify in two ways:

</div>

- Photo Samples (similar to iNaturalist)
- Physical Samples (DNA test)

### Perseverance

Continue removal efforts despite adversity or inability to envision success.

Use when you put forth any substantial effort

#### Tips on Persevering

- Think in geological time. You may not see results in your lifetime.
- Remember first principles: do it because it's right, not because it's easy or for results
- Community support: you aren't alone in the struggle
- Don't do it alone: invasive removal is a communal effort

Note: someone named Liz overheard me and went on a rant about how hard it is to promote native plants

### Planning

Optimize effort to maximize ecological benefit.

Use when you have more work than time

#### Divide and Conquer

<p style="text-align:left">Identify what doesn't require focus:</p>

- Unmanaged barren areas that don't require maintenance (eg. driveway, house, garage).
- Unmanaged native areas that are wild. Check annually before invasives seed/flower.
- Unmanaged invasive areas that are contained. Check annually (no seeds/flowers/vine runners).

Note: example of unmanaged invasive is wintercreeper with no trees, or a smothered area.

#### Divide and Conquer

<p style="text-align:left">And what requires focus:</p>

- Managed native areas that are progressing into wild but still require weeding and invasive removal.
- Managed invasive areas should immediately be converted into managed native or unmanaged invasive by containment.

### Poison

Reduce a plant's energy stores, reproductive means, access to food, or energy production through chemical means.

Use when drastic measures are required

(cancer analogy: destructive means for greater good)

#### Triclopyr

CAUTION! Poison is poison, handle accordingly!

- Put on plastic gloves
- Fill dauber bottle
- Cut plant or bend to expose stem
- Daub a few times until stem cut is saturated
- Do NOT touch your skin!
- Apply when it is not going to rain for 24 hrs

Note: Used by Dept. of Land Stewardship. Alt method is squirt bottle.

#### White Vinegar and Salt

I've experimented with 50% White Vinegar (the regular 3% stuff) and 50% rock salt. Seems to kill growth of that stem, but not entire plant.

### Removal

Remove a plant from an area through mechanical means.

Use when you have strength, soil is wet, and have Bio Material Handling

Note: don't hurt yourself!

#### Plants <2'

<p style="text-align:left">Tend to do fine pulling by hand:</p>

- Key is to get all of the root! Yank at the base, if it snaps dig up the root
- Delicate plants like Creeping Thistle and Japanese Knotweed can sometimes be pulled by hand when the soil is very wet without much fuss.
- Sometimes I first loosen with a quick trowel jab.
- For strong roots like Amur Honeysuckle saplings you can yank away.

#### Plants >2 and <4'

<p style="text-align:left">Requires strategy:</p>

- Usually trunk is less than 1" and the root system can be cut with vigorous shoveling
- Jab shovel every few inches about 4" away from center
- Pry with shovel while pulling vigorously
- Easier when soil is wet.

#### Plants >4'

<p style="text-align:left">Requires more strategy:</p>

- First, cut the canopy down to the ground. Loppers are preferred tool.
- Dig surrounding the stump about 1' away from center. If shovel can't cut the root dig until roots are exposed and use loppers.
- Pry up with bar.

Tips:

- Be careful! Know when its too big.
- Regular stretching and exercise can boost your skill.
- Easier when soil is wet.

#### Vines

- Sweet Autumn Clematis you can role each strand into a ball, find root ball, and dig about 12" down to get root ball
- English Ivy and Wintercreeper are impossible, there isn't a root ball; use another method like Exhaustion

### Legal Understanding

Understand the legal constraints of invasive plant removal.

Use when you have a yard

#### Legal Bias Favorable to Invasives

- It's legal and encouraged to mow everything, which creates the Displacement areas favorable to invasive plants:
  - "neat lawn" aesthetic is favorable to invasive characteristics
  - Disturbed areas by roads and fences are ideal for invasives
- It's legal to grow invasive plants, which can happen even if you mow
  - Plants that don't look like weeds (eg. Black Locust, Amur Honeysuckle, White Mulberry, Tree of Heaven)
  - Vines (Wintercreeper, English Ivy, Sweet Autumn Clematis)
  - Extremely fast seeders (Garlic Mustard)

#### Business & Neighborhood Services (BNS)

<span style="text-align:left">

All vegetation taller than 12" is illegal due to [Indianapolis Code of Ordinances Section 575-2](https://library.municode.com/in/indianapolis_-_marion_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TITIIIPUHEWE_CH575ENPUNU_ARTIINGE_S575-2DE):

</span>

- Whistleblower service May 1 to Oct 31
- City can enter your property to mow and bill you (min. $383)
- Civil enforcement up to $2,500 per day plus court costs
- Dismissal of a violation does not abate future violations
- Failure to pay can become a lien

#### BNS Exemptions

<p style="text-align:left">Exemptions to the rule are:</p>

1. Farming, gardening, horticulture (1)
2. The native area is 150' from an occupied building and health department says it's OK (4)
3. Registered rain garden (6)
4. Registered native planting area (7)

Note: if someone is out to get you your only defense is to get an area registered

#### Health Department

Health Department's [Health and Hospital Code Sec. 10-301, 10-302, 10-303](https://marionhealth.org/resources/) is general "cut and dispose of high weeds and grass" to avoid conditions in which "rodents, mosquitoes, or vectors have food, shelter, or a breeding place".

- No exemptions
- Penalty up to $250 and/or enforcement case up to $2,500 per violation per day
- Health Dept. can enter your property to "correct" and bill you for costs
- Failure to pay can become a lien

#### Commercial Bias Favorable to Invasives

As of 2020 it's "illegal to sell, gift, barter, exchange, distribute, transport, or introduce" invasive plants ([link](https://www.in.gov/dnr/rules-and-regulations/invasive-species/)).

But, only those flagged as illegal which only happens when there's proof of an issue.

- Market will always be faster than legislation.
- People want novel plants and growing characteristics that favor invasive characteristics.
- Native plants are hard to find and are costly.
- Invasive plants don't have to be removed for sale of property

#### Commercial Bias Favorable to Invasives

Example of the bias: you can still buy commonly considered invasives at Dammann's:

- "Beautiful, showy clematis are not as difficult to grow as you might think" ([Accessed Jan 20, 2025](https://dammanns.com/2022/08/30/clematis/))
- "English Ivy makes a fine choice for the outdoor landscape" ([Accessed Jan 20, 2025](http://plants.dammannsgardenco.com/12130021/Plant/201/English_Ivy/))

#### Commercial Bias Favorable to Invasives

What percentage of Dammann's inventory is native?

<div class="fragment">

<p style="font-size:300%;margin-left:2em">< 5%</p>

Note: how many of these will end up on the invasive list?

</div>

### Wilding

Prevent invasive plants from occupying a space through biotic resistance.

Use when you want to minimize effort and maximize ecological benefit

#### Avoid Disturbances

- Key is to make a space where invasives can't get a foothold
- Disturbing areas give invasives a foothold
  - Notice they congregate around fences, suburbs, and highways?
- Remove anything that prevents native growth (eg invasive plants, trash)

#### Biotic Resistance!

It's a numbers game:

- American Black Raspberry > Wintercreeper, Sweet Autumn Clematis
- Riverbank Grapevine > Wintercreeper
- Goldenrod > Wintercreeper, Amur Honeysuckle

#### Buy Natives

Good luck buying natives!

- Stores primarily carry non-natives and hybrids/cultivars. 🤯
- 1-2x/yr INSP and Indy Parks Alliance have a sale.
- Cost prohibitive, $5 for a single plant gets expensive quickly.
- Don't trust the label, know your source.
  - I bought Red Mulberry that PPDL diagnosed as White, <br /> yes the illegal one.

#### Grow Natives

Grow from seed. You can harvest seeds at state parks.

Propagate from other plants.

Transfer from other yards.

## Et Tu, Gato? <!-- omit in toc -->

Cats are an invasive species if you let them outside.

How to treat:

- Put them inside
- Confined outdoor space (eg electric fence or leash)
- Reduce the amount of time outside (eg keep indoors early morning and late afternoon when birds feed)
- Attach a bell to its collar to alert wildlife
- Use a collar that visually alerts wildlife (eg Birdsbesafe)

Visual aids to consider:
- leather gloves, polyester shirt/pants, hat
- triclopyr stuff: dauber bottle, tool to open them, gloves, squirt bottle
- trowel, shovel, pry bar
- photo of burn barrel



NOTES to maybe include?


Ultimately, you decide the future of the species.

60% of land is private so despite what any USDA or IISC list says is invasive they won't do anything about plants in your yard.

Our singular focus is non-native invasive plants that are unquestionably harmful to the native ecosystem.
