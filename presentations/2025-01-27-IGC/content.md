## Terminology

### Native vs Non-Native

Native species are indigenous to the ecosystem.

(eg. Trumpet Vine, Poison Ivy)

Non-native species are not indigenous.

(eg. Amur Honeysuckle, Dandelion)

Resources: [BONAP](http://www.bonap.org/), [USDA](https://plants.usda.gov/), [ITIS](https://www.itis.gov/)

<div class="fragment">

> Native status is difficult to define and is somewhat arbitrary (USDA)

</div>

### Net-negative Benefit

- Offers little or no food supply (for native life)
- Crowds out native plants (which do offer food)
- Changes structure and content of soil (causes erosion, suppression of native growth)

<p class="fragment">
Example: my childhood forrest is now Vinca. Its beauty doesn't outweigh the cost of having no more berries or mushrooms.
</p>

### Managed vs Unmanaged

A managed planting area has humans shaping the ecosystem.

An unmanaged planting area is wild; it does not have humans shaping the ecosystem.

<p class="fragment">
Example: that forrest is unmanaged, but the home and farm nearby where the Vinca came from is managed.
</p>

### Invasive vs Non-Invasive

Invasive species result in net-negative benefit for an ecosystem. (eg. Wintercreeper)

Non-invasive species are neutral or positive. (eg. Tomatoes)

Resources: [GISD](https://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/), [NISIC](https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/terrestrial/plants), [NatureServe](https://explorer.natureserve.org/)

<p class="fragment">
Question: Trumpet Vine is a native, but is considered invasive in managed areas and non-invasive in unmanaged areas?
</p>

## Skills

Skills are how you get rid of invasive plants.

- What is it
- When to use it
- How to apply it

### Bio Material Handling

Handle bio material safely and with control.

Use when interacting with plants (Exhaustion, Poison, Removal)

#### Protective Clothing

You will encounter toxins, thorns, and burrs.

(eg. myocarditis from Tree of Heaven sap)

<p style="text-align:left">Clothing to consider:</p>

- Thick leather gloves (single most important!)
- Long sleeves and long pants with very tight weave (eg polyester running clothes)
- Hat
- Sturdy shoes (eg. leather boots)

#### Biochar

You cannot leave plants to decompose without propagation risk.

Burning them into biochar terminates them, is carbon neutral ([link](https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/questions/7009/is-burning-wood-the-same-as-letting-it-biodegrade-from-a-co2-emissions-perspecti)), and is a soil encrichment ([link](https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/biochar)).

- Option 1: Burn barrel with dolly so you can burn on site. See online videos for strategy and safety considerations.
- Option 2: Trench burn is good at handling large quantities. Requires higher degree of safety working with fire.

#### Bagging

If the plant has gone to seed/fruit make sure you bag it immediately on site.

Treat it as a hazardous material.

Don't leave it in the bag to mold.

### Displacement

Force invasive plants out of their occupied space by promoting native plants.

Use when there is vacant space (Exhaustion, Removal)

#### Promote Strong Natives

- American Black Raspberry > Wintercreeper, Sweet Autumn Clematis
- Riverbank Grapevine > Wintercreeper
- Goldenrod > Wintercreeper

#### Keep Adding Natives

It's a numbers game.

Good luck finding natives for sale! Once or twice a year there's a sale, see INSP and Indy Parks Alliance.

Don't trust the label, know your source. I bought Red Mulberry that PPDL diagnosed as White Mulberry, and WDNR issued stop order for nursery.

Grow from seed. You can harvest seeds at parks.

Propagate.

Transfer from other yards.

### Exhaustion

Reduce a plant's energy stores, reproductive means, access to food, or energy production through mechanical means.

Use when Removal isn't viable

#### Removal of Sources

Plants don't respect fences. Invasive plants are great at propagating from elsewhere.

Talk to your neighbors.

[Irvington Burn Fest](https://www.irvburnfest.com/) on October 5, 2025.

#### Smothering

Cut off energy production (photosynthesis) by covering.

Excellent option for large areas.

First, mow it to the bare ground. Then, add a covering:

- Plastic: UV stabilized plastic, 1000 gauge or 6 mil (~0.15-0.25 mm), remove after a year
- Bio materials: let cover decompose; cut holes and plant plugs; materials:
  - Cardboard: avoid toxic ink and remove tape; secure to ground with sticks
  - Mulch: 2-4" thick

Note: newspaper, dirt, solarization (clear plastic to heat), propane torch

#### Cutting

Range from precision (loppers/clippers/snips) to annihilation (mowing/weed eating).

For plants that don't seed/fruit in their first year (eg White Mulberry) you can precision cut once after spring growth and again in fall before winter. Repeat annually.

Note: I do precision cutting with White Mulberry, Japanese Knotweed, vines that climb (English Ivy, Wintercreeper), Creeping Thistle.

### Identification

Sufficiently determine a plant is invasive.

Use when you interact with any plant

Note: Only need to sufficiently identify, doesn't have to be species.

#### Observe

Look around. Invasive plants are obvious.

- Does it turn green before anything else and stay green longer?
- Do birds know how to nest in it or eat its fruit/seed? (Question of nutritional content)
- How many bugs are there on it versus native plants?
- How quickly does it grow?

Note: See how invasives productivity compares to the best, goldenrod, aster, black raspberry, pokeberry

#### Seek App

Open the app and point. (Apple and Android)

Indicates if native or endangered and gives photos to compare.

Limitations! Some species it doesn't get and sometimes it gets a bad photo.

#### iNaturalist

Online forum where experts will help classify your plants.

Requires higher level of skill and more datapoints.

Contributes to research!

#### PPDL

<div style="text-align:left">

The [Purdue Plant and Pest Diagnostics Lab](https://ag.purdue.edu/department/btny/ppdl/) can identify in two ways:

</div>

- Photo Samples (similar to iNaturalist)
- Physical Samples (DNA test)

### Perseverance

Continue removal efforts despite adversity or inability to envision success.

Use when you put forth any substantial effort

#### Tips on Persevering

- Think in geological time. You may not see results in your lifetime.
- Remember first principles: do it because it's right, not because it's easy or for results
- Community support: you aren't alone in the struggle
- Don't do it alone: invasive removal is a communal effort

Note: someone named Liz overheard me and went on a rant about how hard it is to promote native plants

### Planning

Optimize effort to maximize ecological benefit.

Use when you have more work than time

#### Divide and Conquer

<p style="text-align:left">Identify what doesn't require focus:</p>

- Unmanaged barren areas that don't require maintenance (eg. driveway, house, garage).
- Unmanaged native areas that are wild. Check annually before invasives seed/flower.
- Unmanaged invasive areas that are contained. Check annually (no seeds/flowers/vine runners).

Note: example of unmanaged invasive is wintercreeper with no trees, or a smothered area.

#### Divide and Conquer

<p style="text-align:left">And what requires focus:</p>

- Managed native areas that are progressing into wild but still require weeding and invasive removal.
- Managed invasive areas should immediately be converted into managed native or unmanaged invasive by containment.

### Poison

Reduce a plant's energy stores, reproductive means, access to food, or energy production through chemical means.

Use when drastic measures are required

(cancer analogy: destructive means for greater good)

#### Triclopr

CAUTION! Poison is poison, handle accordingly!

- Put on plastic gloves
- Fill dauber bottle
- Cut plant or bend to expose stem
- Daub a few times until stem cut is saturated
- Do NOT touch your skin!
- Apply when it is not going to rain for 24 hrs

Note: Used by Dept. of Land Stewardship. Alt method is squirt bottle.

#### White Vinegar and Salt

I've experimented with 50% White Vinegar (the regular 3% stuff) and 50% rock salt. Seems to kill growth of that stem, but not entire plant.

### Removal

Remove a plant from an area through mechanical means.

Use when you have strength, soil is wet, and have Bio Material Handling

Note: don't hurt yourself!

#### Plants <2'

<p style="text-align:left">Tend to do fine pulling by hand:</p>

- Key is to get all of the root! Yank at the base, if it snaps dig up the root
- Delicate plants like Creeping Thistle and Japanese Knotweed can sometimes be pulled by hand when the soil is very wet without much fuss.
- Sometimes I first loosen with a quick trowel jab.
- For strong roots like Amur Honeysuckle saplings you can yank away.

#### Plants >2 and <4'

<p style="text-align:left">Requires strategy:</p>

- Usually trunk is less than 1" and the root system can be cut with vigorous shoveling
- Jab shovel every few inches about 4" away from center
- Pry with shovel while pulling vigorously
- Easier when soil is wet.

#### Plants >4'

<p style="text-align:left">Requires more strategy:</p>

- First, cut the canopy down to the ground. Loppers are preferred tool.
- Dig surrounding the stump about 1' away from center. If shovel can't cut the root dig until roots are exposed and use loppers.
- Pry up with bar.

Tips:

- Be careful! Know when its too big.
- Regular stretching and exercise can boost your skill.
- Easier when soil is wet.

#### Vines

- Sweet Autumn Clematis you can role each strand into a ball, find root ball, and dig about 12" down to get root ball
- English Ivy and Wintercreeper are impossible, there isn't a root ball; use another method like Exhaustion

### Legal Understanding

Understand the legal constraints of invasive plant removal.

Use when you have a yard

#### Mowing

- You can mow diligently and still have invasive plants:
  - You must also treat trees, eg. Wintercreeper all around South Irvington Circle
  - If not frequent enough some plants will seed quickly, eg. Garlic Mustard
- Mowing, generally, is an effective method of Exhaustion

#### Not-Mowing (eg. Displacement or Wilding)

<span style="text-align:left">

Many natives are taller than 12" which are illegal due to [Indianapolis Code of Ordinances Section 575-2](https://library.municode.com/in/indianapolis_-_marion_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TITIIIPUHEWE_CH575ENPUNU_ARTIINGE_S575-2DE):

</span>

- BNR runs a whistleblower service May 1 to Oct 31
- Violations can be $2,000 per day (depending on dept. pursuing you)
- City can enter your property to mow and bill you, and failure to apy can become a lien

#### Not-Mowing (eg. Displacement or Wilding)

<p style="text-align:left">Exceptions to the rule are:</p>

1. Farming, gardening, horticulture (1)
2. The native area is 150' from an occupied building and health department says it's OK (4)
3. Registered rain garden (6)
4. Registered native planting area (7)

Note: if someone is out to get you your only defense is to get an area registered

#### Buying Invasives

As of 2020 it's "illegal to sell, gift, barter, exchange, distribute, transport, or introduce" invasive plants ([link](https://www.in.gov/dnr/rules-and-regulations/invasive-species/)).

<div class="fragment">

It's not illegal to have invasives on your property and sell it, eg. many people cultivate Amur Honeysuckle.

</div>

### Wilding

Dedicate an area to become an unmanaged native area.

Use when you want to minimize effort and maximize ecological benefit

#### Avoid Disturbances

- Key is to make a space where invasives can't get a foothold
- Disturbing areas give invasives a foothold
  - Notice they congregate around fences, suburbs, and highways?
- Remove anything that prevents native growth (eg invasive plants, trash)

- am I liable for https://www.in.gov/dnr/rules-and-regulations/invasive-species/terrestrial-invasive-species-plants/ ?




NOTES to maybe include?


- What about native Trumpet Vine and Goldenrod or non-native Dandylion and White Clover?
- How bad does it have to be to be invasive?
- Is a grass yard with 20% natives worse than a native yard but 20% invasives?
- How much of the USDA and IISC invasive lists are driven by economics versus ecology?


Ultimately, you decide the future of the species.

60% of land is private so despite what any USDA or IISC list says is invasive they won't do anything about plants in your yard.

Our singular focus is non-native invasive plants that are unquestionably harmful to the native ecosystem.
