# How to Remove Invasive Plants

## Audience

Assumptions:

- You know the importance of getting rid of invasive plants (impact on state parks and local ecology)
- You take ownership over your spaces and want to do it better

## Overview

1. Terminology
2. Skills

## Part I. Terminology

- Invasive vs non-invasive
- Non-native vs native
- Managed vs unmanaged area

### Identify

start with why; if you don’t know what you’re doing and why you can easily work against yourself

When to use: start here; never remove a plant unless you know what it is and 1 reason it’s beneficial

- Tech: iNaturalist, Seek
- Compare: growing in same spot, there’s others nearby
- Observe: is it everywhere, do you see native bugs and birds successfully interacting with it
- Listen to people complain: naughty list
  - Winter creeper: this might be impossible to beat
  - Clematis: it’s aggressive, kills all beneath
  - Amur: suppressive chemicals
  - White mulberry
  - English Ivy
  - Tree of heaven
  - Creeping thistle
  - Stickseed
  - Poison Ivy
  - Spanish needles
- Flip it: know the best: goldenrod, aster, black raspberry, pokeberry

### Poison

Poison: permanently kill by chemical means; this is the most difficult option, you must handle with care and do so knowing risks

When to use: “cancer” analogy

- Not covered is roundup (bc Triclopyr is what’s used) and spraying (bc it’s more aggressive and careless than what I like, which is precision)
- Substances
  - Triclopyr
  - White vinegar
  - Salt
- Application
  - Dauber
  - Squirt bottle
  - Dawn bottle
- Technique
  - Cut then apply
  - Use gloves and eye protection
  - Don’t do it when it rains, 24 hrs

### Exhaust

Exhaust: if a plant can’t grow it will die; this is easiest option that still allows native growth, fool proof

When to use: you can’t dig them up and don’t want to use poison

- Keys are to prevent photosynthesis and propagation
- Do it at least once but probably twice: once after spring growth and again in Sep before winter
- Cut every year (white mulberry, knotweed, vines, creeping thistle)
  - Loppers
  - Clippers
  - Weed eater
- Get rid of source
  - Make sure any mature plants nearby are removed (see also burn fest)
  - Carry seeds in bags and burn

### Smother

Smother: prevent access to sunlight or water; this is easiest option but doesn’t allow native growth

When to use: there’s nothing salvageable in the area AND you want to prepare an area for native plugs OR you want to minimize management area

- Mow/weed down to dirt (optional in some cases, eg thick plastic)
- Add a covering
  - Plastic
  - Cardboard: pain because you need to acquire the boxes, make sure they don’t have toxic ink, remove tape, arrange, secure to ground
  - Mulch: has to be a thick layer
  - Ideally some kind of dirt with native seeds
  - Keep it covered? Decorative rocks

### Remove

Remove: entirely remove the plant

When to use: this is the default, it’s maximum good; only cases to not use it is “cancer” or nothing salvageable

- Dig: don’t hurt yourself
- Cut roots w loppers
- Pry up with bar
- Wait till it’s wet
- Pull roots
- BURN! Many plants regrow

### Displace

Displace: a naturalized system I disturbed from humans will be stable

When to use: this always pairs with removal; nature will fill the void, and without human intervention it will get filled with non native plants

- Know strong plants: these can propagate and grow in the middle of Ivy
  - Am black raspberry
  - Riverbank grape vine
  - Goldenrod
- Buy or grow natives; good luck! INPS sales and conference, Indy parks alliance. Not sure when they will be announced
- Get as many native plants in your yard; in part it’s a numbers game in our neighborhood.

### Handling Bio Material

Handling bio material: how to safely handle these plants (safe for self and environment)

When to use: always

- Treat the entire plant like a hazardous substance
- Tree of heaven causes heart arythmia
- Know when the plant has gone to seed/fruit, because at that point you need to bag it at the site of removal
- Also bag anything that can regrow like vine clippings or knotweed tubers
- Sometimes you can compose: I have a single spot where I heap leafy invasives that won’t burn well (knotweed, clematis)
- Sometimes you can burn
  - Burn barrel $20 is so versatile; there’s an art to burning, need to be mindful of how wet the environment is, how wet the material is
  - Trench burn is cool but not practical
  - Biochar

### Perseverance

Perseverance: think in geological time. You may not see results in your lifetime.
