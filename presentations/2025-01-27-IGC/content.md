## Terminology

### Native vs Non-Native

Native species are indigenous to the ecosystem.

(eg. Trumpet Vine, Poison Ivy)

Non-native species are not indigenous.

(eg. Amur Honeysuckle, Dandelion)

Resources: [BONAP](http://www.bonap.org/), [USDA](https://plants.usda.gov/), [ITIS](https://www.itis.gov/)

<div class="fragment">

> Native status is difficult to define and is somewhat arbitrary (USDA)

</div>

### Net-negative Benefit

- Offers little or no food supply (for native life)
- Crowds out native plants (which do offer food)
- Changes structure and content of soil (causes erosion, suppression of native growth)

<p class="fragment">
Example: my childhood forrest is now Vinca. Its beauty doesn't outweigh the cost of having no more berries or mushrooms.
</p>

### Managed vs Unmanaged

A managed area requires human upkeep.

An unmanaged area requires little or no human involvement (eg. a day a year to audit).

<p class="fragment">
Example: my childhood forrest is unmanaged, but the home and farm nearby where the Vinca came from is managed.
</p>

### Invasive vs Non-Invasive

Invasive species result in net-negative benefit for an ecosystem. (eg. Fortune's Spindle)

Non-invasive species are neutral or positive. (eg. Tomatoes)

Resources: [IISC](https://ag.purdue.edu/department/entm/iisc/), [GISD](https://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/), [NISIC](https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/terrestrial/plants), [NatureServe](https://explorer.natureserve.org/)

### Perspective Matters <!-- omit in toc -->

Trumpet Vine is a non-invasive native in Indiana ([USDA](https://plants.usda.gov/plant-profile/CARA2), [Natureserve](https://explorer.natureserve.org/Taxon/ELEMENT_GLOBAL.2.148989/Campsis_radicans)).

In practice some call it invasive because it invades managed areas (eg. gardens).

Poison Ivy is native...

## Skills

Skills are how you get rid of invasive plants.

- What is it
- When to use it
- How to apply it

### 1. Bio Material Handling

Handle bio material safely and with control.

Use when interacting with plants (Exhaustion, Poison, Removal)

#### Protective Clothing

You will encounter toxins, thorns, and burrs.

(eg. myocarditis from Tree of Heaven sap entering bloodstream via open blisters)

<p style="text-align:left">Clothing to consider:</p>

- Thick leather gloves (single most important!)
- Long sleeves and long pants with very tight weave (eg polyester running clothes)
- Hat
- Sturdy shoes (eg. leather boots)

#### Biochar

You cannot leave plants to decompose without propagation risk.

Burning them into biochar terminates them, is carbon neutral ([link](https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/questions/7009/is-burning-wood-the-same-as-letting-it-biodegrade-from-a-co2-emissions-perspecti)), and is a soil encrichment ([link](https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/biochar)).

- Option 1: Burn barrel with dolly so you can burn on site. See online videos for strategy and safety considerations.
- Option 2: Trench burn is good at handling large quantities. Requires higher degree of safety working with fire.

#### Bagging

If the plant has gone to seed/fruit make sure you bag it immediately on site using non-porous bag (eg. plastic).

Treat it as a hazardous material.

Don't leave it in the bag to mold.

### 2. Displacement

Prevent invasive plants from occupying a space.

Use when there is vacant space (Exhaustion, Removal)

#### Methods

Two main methods:

1. Convert to barren areas, eg. rocks, mulch, parking lots, buildings.
2. Convert to native areas, see also "Wilding".

### 3. Exhaustion

Reduce a plant's energy stores, reproductive means, access to food, or energy production through mechanical means.

Use when Removal isn't viable

#### Removal of Sources

Plants don't respect fences. Invasive plants are great at propagating from elsewhere.

Talk to your neighbors.

[Irvington Burn Fest](https://www.irvburnfest.com/) on October 5, 2025.

#### Smothering

Cut off energy production (photosynthesis) by covering.

Excellent option for large areas.

First, mow it to the bare ground. Then, add a covering:

- Plastic: UV stabilized plastic, 1000 gauge or 6 mil (~0.15-0.25 mm), remove after a year
- Bio materials: let cover decompose; cut holes and plant plugs; materials:
  - Cardboard: avoid toxic ink and remove tape; secure to ground with sticks
  - Mulch: 2-4" thick

Note: newspaper, dirt, solarization (clear plastic to heat), propane torch

#### Cutting

Range from precision (loppers/clippers/snips) to annihilation (mowing/weed eating).

For plants that don't seed/fruit in their first year (eg White Mulberry) you can precision cut once after spring growth and again in fall before winter. Repeat annually.

Note: I do precision cutting with White Mulberry, Japanese Knotweed, vines that climb (English Ivy, Fortune's Spindle), Creeping Thistle.

### 4. Identification

Sufficiently determine a plant is invasive.

Use when you interact with any plant

Note: Only need to sufficiently identify, doesn't have to be species.

#### Observe

Look around. Invasive plants are obvious. (All around Irvington Circle, Pennsy Trail, yards).

- Does it turn green before anything else and stay green longer?
- Do birds know how to nest in it or eat its fruit/seed? (Question of nutritional content)
- How many bugs are there on it versus native plants?
- How quickly does it grow?

Note: See how invasives productivity compares to the best, goldenrod, aster, black raspberry, pokeberry

#### Seek App

Open the app and point. (Apple and Android)

Indicates if native or endangered and gives photos to compare.

Limitations! Some species it doesn't get and sometimes it gets a bad photo.

#### iNaturalist

Online forum where experts will help classify your plants.

Requires higher level of skill and more datapoints.

Contributes to research!

#### Genetic Testing

<div style="text-align:left">

The [Purdue Plant and Pest Diagnostics Lab (PPDL)](https://ag.purdue.edu/department/btny/ppdl/) can identify in two ways:

</div>

- Photo Samples (similar to iNaturalist)
- Physical Samples (DNA test)

### 5. Perseverance

Continue removal efforts despite adversity or inability to envision success.

Use when you put forth any substantial effort

#### Tips on Persevering

- Think in geological time. You may not see results in your lifetime.
- 1 plant at a time. 1 year at a time.
- Remember first principles: do it because it's right, not because it's easy or for results
- Community support: you aren't alone in the struggle
- Don't do it alone: invasive removal is a communal effort

Note: someone named Liz overheard me and went on a rant about how hard it is to promote native plants

### 6. Planning

Optimize effort to maximize ecological benefit.

Use when you have more work than time

#### Divide and Conquer

<p style="text-align:left">Identify what doesn't require focus:</p>

- Unmanaged barren areas that don't require maintenance (eg. driveway, house, garage).
- Unmanaged native areas that are wild. Check annually before invasives seed/flower.
- Unmanaged invasive areas that are contained. Check annually (no seeds/flowers/vine runners).

Note: example of unmanaged invasive is Fortune's Spindle with no trees, or a smothered area.

#### Divide and Conquer

<p style="text-align:left">And what requires focus:</p>

- Managed native areas that are progressing into wild but still require weeding and invasive removal.
- Managed invasive areas should immediately be converted into managed native or unmanaged invasive by containment.

### 7. Poison

Reduce a plant's energy stores, reproductive means, access to food, or energy production through chemical means.

Use when drastic measures are required

(cancer analogy: destructive means for greater good)

#### Herbicide Calendar

State of Indiana Cooperative Invasives Management (SICIM) has an herbicide calendar for most effective treatment and other resources ([link](https://www.sicim.info/control-and-management)).

#### Triclopyr

CAUTION! Poison is poison, handle accordingly!

- Put on plastic gloves
- Fill dauber bottle
- Cut plant or bend to expose stem
- Daub a few times until stem cut is saturated
- Do NOT touch your skin!
- Apply when it is not going to rain for 24 hrs

Note: Used by Dept. of Land Stewardship. Alt method is squirt bottle.

#### White Vinegar and Salt

I've experimented with 50% White Vinegar (the regular 3% stuff) and 50% rock salt. Seems to kill growth of that stem, but not entire plant.

### 8. Removal

Remove a plant from an area through mechanical means.

Use when you have strength, soil is wet, and have Bio Material Handling

Note: don't hurt yourself!

#### Plants <2'

<p style="text-align:left">Tend to do fine pulling by hand:</p>

- Key is to get all of the root! Yank at the base, if it snaps dig up the root
- Delicate plants like Creeping Thistle and Japanese Knotweed can sometimes be pulled by hand when the soil is very wet without much fuss.
- Sometimes I first loosen with a quick trowel jab.
- For strong roots like Amur Honeysuckle saplings you can yank away.

#### Plants 2-4'

<p style="text-align:left">Requires strategy:</p>

- Usually trunk is less than 1" and the root system can be cut with vigorous shoveling
- Jab shovel every few inches about 4" away from center
- Pry with shovel while pulling vigorously
- Easier when soil is wet.

#### Plants >4'

<p style="text-align:left">Requires more strategy:</p>

- First, cut the canopy down to the ground. Loppers are preferred tool.
- Dig surrounding the stump about 1' away from center. If shovel can't cut the root dig until roots are exposed and use loppers.
- Pry up with bar.

Tips:

- Be careful! Know when its too big.
- Regular stretching and exercise can boost your skill.
- Easier when soil is wet.

#### Vines

- Sweet Autumn Clematis you can role each strand into a ball, find root ball, and dig about 12" down to get root ball
- English Ivy and Fortune's Spindle are impossible, there isn't a root ball; use another method like Exhaustion

### 9. Legal Understanding

Understand the legal constraints of invasive plant removal.

Use when you are Bio Materia Handling or Wilding

#### Vegetation Height: BNS

[Indianapolis Code of Ordinances Section 575-2](https://library.municode.com/in/indianapolis_-_marion_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TITIIIPUHEWE_CH575ENPUNU_ARTIINGE_S575-2DE) mandates vegetation be lower than 12" and is enforced by the Bureau of Neighborhood Services (BNS).

- Whistleblower service May 1 to Oct 31
- City can enter your property to mow and bill you (min. $383)
- Civil enforcement up to $2,500 per day plus court costs
- Dismissal of a violation does not abate future violations
- Failure to pay can become a lien

#### Vegetation Height: BNS

Exemptions:

1. Farming, gardening, horticulture (1)
2. The native area is 150' from an occupied building and health department says it's OK (4)
3. Registered rain garden (6)
4. Registered native planting area (7)

#### Vegetation Height: Health Department

Health Department's [Health and Hospital Code Sec. 10-301, 10-302, 10-303](https://marionhealth.org/resources/) is general "cut and dispose of high weeds and grass" to avoid conditions in which "rodents, mosquitoes, or vectors have food, shelter, or a breeding place".

- No exemptions
- Penalty up to $250 and/or enforcement case up to $2,500 per violation per day
- Health Dept. can enter your property to "correct" and bill you for costs
- Failure to pay can become a lien

#### Disposal in Trash

- Vegetative matter produces methane in anaerobic environments, so trash is not a good option.
  - However, [Indiana Code 13-20-9](https://iga.in.gov/laws/2024/ic/titles/13#13-20-9) allows grass or bundled/bagged woody vegetative matter less <3', but not leaves.
  - Municipalities can establish their own ordinances, I couldn't find one for Marion County.
  - Illegal dumping can be a fine up to $2,500.
  - Indy's South Side Landfill captures methane.
- Dropoff with fee at the [Citizen's Transfer station](https://www.indy.gov/activity/citizens-transfer-station) (Assume it goes to landfill?)

#### Disposal via Composting

Nothing restricts composting at home, however Health Department flagged my piles of sticks and said they need to be in a compost bin. I made 4' diameter circles using 4' tall chicken wire.

Can also dropoff at a [composting facility listed by IDEM](https://www.in.gov/idem/waste/waste-industries/yard-waste-and-composting-facilities/).

#### Disposal via Burning

While allowed by IDEM it advises against open burning citing harm to human health and environment ([link](https://www.in.gov/idem/waste/waste-industries/yard-waste-and-composting-facilities/), [link](https://www.in.gov/idem/openburning/health-risks-and-environmental-impacts/)).

[Indianapolis Code of Ordinances Section 511-703](https://library.municode.com/in/indianapolis_-_marion_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TITIIIPUHEWE_CH511AIPOCO_ARTVIIGEPR_S511-703LIBUSPPU) allows burning dried limbs, twigs, and branches (but not leaves): originating from the property, between 10 am and 3 pm, 15 ft. distance, sufficiently vented with mesh covering max 0.25", and always attended with means to extinguish.

See also [indy.gov](https://www.indy.gov/activity/open-burning) and [in.gov](https://www.in.gov/dhs/get-prepared/fire-safety/open-burning/) for info and tips.

Potential liability or fines if fire causes damages or is unsafe.

#### Legality of Sale and Ownership

Since 2020 the [Indiana Terrestrial Plant Rule 312 IAC 18-3-25](https://iar.iga.in.gov/code/2026/312/18#312-18-3-25) makes it illegal to "sell, offer or grow for sale, gift, barter, exchange, or distribute a species" that's on the list of 44 plants. The only thing you can do if someone owns them is report them to the DNR.

The one exception is Tree of Heaven. [Indianapolis Code of Ordinances Section 391-112](https://library.municode.com/in/indianapolis_-_marion_county/codes/code_of_ordinances/358893?nodeId=TITIIPUORSA_CH391NU_ARTIINGE_S391-112AITRTRHEDENU) saysit is public nuisance and you must "remove it upon notice by the city to do so", which can be enforced with fines. City is expected to remove them.

Note: Can you report Tree of Heaven to the city? What about all those by Butler and E Market?

#### Opinion: Legal Bias Favorable to Invasives

- It's legal and encouraged to mow everything, which creates the Displacement areas favorable to invasive plants:
  - "neat lawn" aesthetic is favorable to invasive characteristics
  - Disturbed areas by roads and fences are ideal for invasives
- It's legal to grow invasive plants, which can happen even if you mow
  - Plants that don't look like weeds (eg. Black Locust, Amur Honeysuckle, White Mulberry, Tree of Heaven)
  - Vines (Fortune's Spindle, English Ivy, Sweet Autumn Clematis)
  - Extremely fast seeders (Garlic Mustard)

#### Opinion: Commercial Bias Favorable to Invasives

Only flagged species are illegal which happens only if there's proof of an issue.

- Market will always be faster than legislation.
- People want novel plants and growing characteristics that favor invasive characteristics.
- Native plants are hard to find and are costly.
- Invasive plants don't have to be removed for sale of property

#### Opinion: Commercial Bias Favorable to Invasives

[INPS notes](https://indiananativeplants.org/invasive-plants/) nurseries still sell commonly considered invasive species.

Dammann's for example:

- "Beautiful, showy [Sweet Autumn] clematis are not as difficult to grow as you might think" ([Accessed Jan 20, 2025](https://dammanns.com/2022/08/30/clematis/))
- "English Ivy makes a fine choice for the outdoor landscape" ([Accessed Jan 20, 2025](http://plants.dammannsgardenco.com/12130021/Plant/201/English_Ivy/))
- Plant inventory is <5% native. (Source: [Dammann's Sitemap.xml](http://plants.dammannsgardenco.com/12130021/SiteMapXML), analyzed by eyeballing and using an LLM (Claude by Anthropic))

Note: how many of these will end up on the invasive list?

</div>

### 10. Wilding

Prevent invasive plants from occupying a space through biotic resistance.

Use when you want to minimize effort and maximize ecological benefit

#### Avoid Disturbances

- Key is to make a space where invasives can't get a foothold
- Disturbing areas give invasives a foothold
  - Notice they congregate around fences, suburbs, and highways?
- Remove anything that prevents native growth (eg invasive plants, trash)

#### Biotic Resistance!

It's a numbers game:

- American Black Raspberry > Fortune's Spindle, Sweet Autumn Clematis
- Riverbank Grapevine > Fortune's Spindle
- Goldenrod > Fortune's Spindle, Amur Honeysuckle

#### Buy Natives

_Warning: Buying natives is very hard to do relative to how easy it is to buy nearly anything else imaginable._

- Stores primarily carry non-natives and hybrids/cultivars. 🤯
- Cost prohibitive, $5 for a single plant gets expensive quickly.
- Don't trust the label, know your source.
- March 1 online and May 3-18 in-person is [Indy Urban Acres](https://www.iuaplantsale.com/) plant sale
- INPS has a [Buy Natives Directory](https://indiananativeplants.org/landscaping/where-to-buy/), an annual auction, and a seed swap at the annual conference

Note: I bought Red Mulberry that PPDL genetic tested as White, yes the illegal one.

#### Grow Natives

Grow from seed. You can harvest seeds at state parks.

Propagate from other plants.

Transfer from other yards.

#### Register

Fill out the [Dept. of Land Stewardship](https://www.indy.gov/activity/land-stewardship) form by listing

At least 70% native and maintained according to guide

Post the "Registered Native Planting Area" sign

Re-register every 3 years

## Non-Native Naughty List

#### 1. Amur Honeysuckle (Lonicera maacki)

Treatment: <2' pull when ground is wet. 2-4' shovel jab and pull when ground is wet. >4' dig stump or cut down to stump and daub w/herbicide.

#### 2. Fortune's Spindle (Euonymus fortunei)

Treatment: only seeds on trees in Fall, so keep off! For patches, grind down to ground and smother.

#### 3. Sweet Autumn Clematis (Clematis terniflora)

Treatment: seeds everywhere in Fall; roll up strand-by-strand and shovel 12" to dig up root ball.

#### 4. White Mulberry (Morus alba)

Treatment: doesn't fruit till mature; cut annually to exhaust or cut to stump and daub w/herbicide

Note: too physically difficult to dig or pull up

#### 5. Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus altissima)

Treatment: doesn't fruit till mature; cut to stump and daub w/herbicide

Note: too fragile to dig/pull up; can't exhaust because it root sprouts

#### Et Tu, Gato? <!-- omit in toc -->

Cats are an invasive species if you let them outside.

How to treat:

- Put them inside
- Confined outdoor space (eg electric fence or leash)
- Reduce the amount of time outside (eg keep indoors early morning and late afternoon when birds feed)
- Attach a bell to its collar to alert wildlife
- Use a collar that visually alerts wildlife (eg Birdsbesafe)

NOTES to maybe include?


Ultimately, you decide the future of the species.

60% of land is private so despite what any USDA or IISC list says is invasive they won't do anything about plants in your yard.

Our singular focus is non-native invasive plants that are unquestionably harmful to the native ecosystem.
