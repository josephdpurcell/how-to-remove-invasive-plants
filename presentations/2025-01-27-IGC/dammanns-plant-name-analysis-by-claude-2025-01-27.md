# Analysis of Plant List Native Status

After reviewing the comprehensive list of ornamental plants, only a small percentage are native to the United States. Here are the confirmed native species (approximately 5-7% of the total list):

## Native Plants from the List:
- American Hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana)
- Black Gum (Nyssa sylvatica)
- Buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis)
- Celandine Poppy (Stylophorum diphyllum)
- Common Pawpaw (Asimina triloba)
- Eastern Redbud (Cercis canadensis)
- Indian Pink (Spigelia marilandica)
- Northern Maidenhair Fern (Adiantum pedatum)
- Ostrich Fern (Matteuccia struthiopteris)
- Pagoda Dogwood (Cornus alternifolia)
- Prairie Dropseed (Sporobolus heterolepis)
- Prairie Smoke (Geum triflorum)
- Red Chokeberry (Aronia arbutifolia)
- Red Oak (Quercus rubra)
- Red Osier Dogwood (Cornus sericea)
- Sensitive Fern (Onoclea sensibilis)
- Shingle Oak (Quercus imbricaria)
- Sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum)
- Spicebush (Lindera benzoin)
- Swamp White Oak (Quercus bicolor)
- Virginia Creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia)

## Analysis
- Total native plants identified: 21
- Total plants in list: approximately 650
- Percentage native: approximately 3.2%

## Notable Observations:
1. The vast majority of plants in the list are non-native ornamentals, many from Asia (particularly Japan)
2. Many plants are cultivars or hybrid varieties of both native and non-native species
3. Some plants listed are actually invasive in parts of the U.S. (e.g., Japanese Barberry, English Ivy)
4. Several native plants in the list are actually cultivated varieties of native species, which may not provide the same ecological benefits as the straight species

This analysis demonstrates the overwhelming preference for non-native ornamental plants in the horticultural trade, which supports your earlier point about legal and cultural biases favoring non-native species.
